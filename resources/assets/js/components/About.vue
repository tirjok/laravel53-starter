                <h4 name="60df" class="graf--p">Introducing Official Bootstrap themes from the founders of
                    Bootstrap.</h4>

                <p name="d493" class="graf--p">In the last four years we’ve spent thousands of hours designing and
                    developing Bootstrap and other open source projects for millions of people and sites across the web.
                    In that time we’ve also helped to build some amazing products like Twitter, GitHub, Medium, and
                    more. Now, we’re hoping to do it with our own business by creating and selling high quality
                    Bootstrap themes.</p>

                <p name="d9d4" class="graf--p">To start, we’re launching with three themes, one for each of the most
                    popular types of Bootstrapped sites — dashboards, applications, and marketing sites. Each theme
                    includes:</p>
                <ul class="postList">
                    <li name="d762" class="graf--li">Beautiful example pages</li>
                    <li name="8ffb" class="graf--li">Custom documentation</li>
                    <li name="daaf" class="graf--li">Several brand new, custom components</li>
                    <li name="e5dc" class="graf--li">Source Less and JavaScript files</li>
                    <li name="bece" class="graf--li">Easy build tools with Gulp</li>
                </ul>
                <p name="243f" class="graf--p">We’ve designed our themes as toolkits, just like Bootstrap, to provide
                    you with a highly functional, visually consistent, and beautiful set of components.</p>

                <p name="6389" class="graf--p">While Bootstrap is free for everyone, these themes are only available for
                    purchase. We decided to sell them for a few reasons:</p>
                <ul class="postList">
                    <li name="89a7" class="graf--li">We think they’re worth it. Each of us has years of experience
                        building for the web — from products to frameworks — and we’ve poured all of that into these
                        themes.
                    </li>
                    <li name="81fc" class="graf--li">We keep Bootstrap funded and available for everyone. To date, we
                        have never taken money from investors and have no corporate sponsorships. All our expenses are
                        paid for by us through ad revenue on our docs.
                    </li>
                    <li name="1f3d" class="graf--li">We can give more back to the Bootstrap and open source communities
                        with event sponsorships, swag, and more open source projects.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p name="857d" class="graf--p">Bootstrap’s entire mission is to help awesome people do awesome stuff.
                    It’s been our goal since day one and we’re excited to take that to another level with Bootstrap
                    Themes.</p>
